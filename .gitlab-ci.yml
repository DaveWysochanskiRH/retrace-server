# Workflow
# 0. Create a topic branch based off of 'master' and test
# * PASS: put in PR to 'dev' and go to step #1
# * FAIL: revert to 'last known good'
#
# 1. Merge topic to 'dev' and test
# * PASS: put in PR to 'prod' and go to step #2
# * FAIL: revert to 'last known good'
#
# 2. Merge 'dev' to 'prod' and test
# * PASS: put in PR to 'master' and go to step #3
# * FAIL: revert to 'last known good'
#
# 3. Push to 'master'
#
# Revert
# a) Use 'master' branch for 'last known good' where at all possible.
# * NOTE: There is also a 'galvatron-stable' that can be used but must be kept updated
# b) Use '--force' on 'prod' and 'dev' branches for revert.
# * NOTE: Since 'prod' is protected branch in gitlab, you must first unprotect before --force push
# * See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/issues/63436
#
# NOTE: For pulls from upstream abrt project, use 'upstream' as topic branch,
# then go to step 0
